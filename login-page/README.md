# Login Page

## About
This is a simple login page, connected to a local database. This database has no password and uses the "root" user.
## Usage
To use this yourself, you need to have a MySQL database. <br> 
If you already have one, copy the code from "sql.txt" and paste it into the MySQL Terminal. <br>
If you dont have a database yet, you can create one via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/">XAMPP</a> and then follow the other steps.
## Note
Sometimes you need to manually maneuver to your "index.php" file, as some PC'S cannot open php as a file by default.
